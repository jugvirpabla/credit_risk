# Credit_Risk

## Project Overview
We started with loading our dependncies, then loaded and cleaned the csv in Pandas DataFrame.
After that, the data was split into training and testing. Then we ran Oversampling, SMOTE Oversampling, Undersampling, a combination of both over and under sampling using SMOTEENN.

I am pretty sure I ran my code wrong because the pre. data points was always the same in every type of sampling, but the F1 score varied, making the Naive Random Oversampling method giving the best results, but we look at accuracy, the SMOTE oversampling gave a result of 66%. 

I would love to learn what I did incorrecly so I can learn from my mistakes, and make these models work better in the future.
